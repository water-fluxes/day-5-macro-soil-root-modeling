# Day 5 - Coupling between Couvreur model and Hydrus-1D with MARSHAL

MARSHAL takes to output of CPlantBox (the root architecture file) to compute the water flow in the system and compute macro properties

## Import a root system from CPlantBox
The created root system should be older than 60 days and for a fast example it works fine with files that are less than 2000 Ko

## Import root conductivities

## Check the soil hydraulic properties

## Download this github repo and run locally

- Locally: Rscript Main.R
